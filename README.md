# Cubic-Spline-Interpolation
(MatLab) m-files take an input of coordinates, and generates a cubic spline interpolation

Please see the report PDF to see the program generate a cubic-spline interpolation piecewise function on an airfoil


Part 1 m.file generates a matrice for each 4 constants of the piece wise functions.

Part 1 does the calculations for top and bottom half of the the airfoil
-Y Axis splits the airfoil in half

Part 2 m.file takes those constants, and computes the area using trapezoidal rule to an error of 10^-8.
